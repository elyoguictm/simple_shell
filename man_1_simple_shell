.SH NAME

- simple command interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
simple_shell [command_string | file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
The simple_shell reads lines from the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.  It is the program that is running when the user runs gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh and runs the executable file, \
./hsh. The simple_shell implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, along with built in history and line editing capabilities.  It incorporat\
es many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can b\
e put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.

.SH OVERVIEW
- simple_shell is a command-line interpreter that executes commands from the standard input.
